Choosing Technology Stack for Mobile App Development,"Making a new app is like making a new house. In that case, you need practical tools and materials to make your house strong. Mobile app development is not different from that. So, you should choose the best mobile app technology stack. A combined technology stack with the programming language, platform, framework, and other SDKs tools. Here are some categories of the mobile stack you will need to consider. Different platforms need different technology stacks to develop mobile applications. For example, iOS and Android are different structures, and they both need different styles & technology. Apple Inc. uses two major programming languages to develop its iOS mobile application. These are- Objective-C is a programming language that is only used to develop iOS applications. Though it has object-oriented potential and dynamic runtime, many prefer Swift to avoid complexity. On the other hand, Swift is a new programming language with a lot of benefits. It requires a smaller amount of code and easier to understand and debug. Because of the speed, readability, and simplicity, Swift is preferable to developers in 2021. According to a survey, 68% (sixty-eight percent) of developers prefer Swift to Objective-C language. Besides programming languages, Apple developers use popular toolsets like AppCode and Xcode. These two are popular iOS app development tools. In the case of developing UI Frameworks, iOS app developers use UIKit and SwiftUI. These two are almost similar and being used to develop the graphical components. But, SwiftUI supports only the newer versions of iOS. Reference: App Development Stack Survey Java is the most popular programming language to develop Android mobile applications. It is also the best for Android APIs and provides a wide variety. On the other hand, Kotlin is less popular than Java but crucial for mobile applications. This programming language was specially designed for the scientific community. But it is compatible with Java Virtual Machine. Android mobile app developers use both Java and Kotlin to develop android mobile applications. For example, C++, Java, Kotlin, and JavaScript are considerable languages for blockchain mobile app development. Android Development Tools, Android Studio, and ADT (Android Developers Tool) are great tools for developing mobile applications. Android Studio is Google’s official platform and used for editing and debugging the code. Apart from that, ADT offers coding and test automation support. For UI Frameworks, Android provides pre-built UI software. As a result, it is a more accessible platform to build user interfaces. Besides, Jetpack is another best UI kit to develop Android user interfaces. It also requires less code.",mobile
Including MVP (Minimum Viable Product) Elements,"The must-have features in an application are called MVP or Minimum viable products.

And UI/UX design is the most crucial in mobile software development. So, make your UX/UI interactive, intuitive, and user-friendly.",mobile
Building Wireframes,"Most of the developers use pencil sketches to draw wireframes on paper. Unfortunately, it is a time-consuming and very complex process. But using a digital wireframe tool for sketching can be a great alternative to that. The digital wireframe tool also allows drawing on paper too. So you can do it in both ways. Wireframes are just sketches of your planning. In this process, the low-fidelity mockups help you to understand the visual concept of the application. You don’t need to think about the color schemes and styles while building wireframes. Here, the most important thing is focusing on aesthetics and user experience.",mobile
Style Guides,"A style guide is a set of propositions for writing, formatting, and designing documents. Many often call it a style sheet, but it has different meanings for different purposes. Style guides help a lot to develop mobile app design strategies. Therefore, making an early style guide will improve your development and the productivity of the developers. To make a consistent-looking app, you should use app-style guides from Apple Inc. for iOS apps and Google for Android apps. User interfaces and Wireframes can get tricky or in the wrong way. But a style guide will provide exact direction to your UI designers. It will help them understand what fonts, colors, and icons they should use in specific positions. Here are some essential things you must consider for your mobile app development style guides.",mobile
Mockups,"The final renderings of your visual application are Mockups. These are also called high-fidelity designs of the app. When you apply a style guide into wireframes, it is time you create Mockups. In that case, Adobe Photoshop can help you create high-fidelity mockups. Therefore, Adobe Photoshop is considered the best tool to design mockups. Combining mockups, wireframes, and style guides, you build the final version of the app. Then the app will be ready for prototyping. After finishing this stage, you will be able to make further modifications. Besides Photoshop, Figma, Sketch, and Adobe XD are popular tools for mockup designing.",mobile
Prototype,"Prototyping is sharing the app designs with your teams, friends, and others to get their suggestions and feedback. For prototyping the application, most developers use tools like InvisionApp. However, some use Xcode to prototype their mobile app into the development stage. If you will pitch your app to investors, then the prototyping process is essential for you. In this process, you can add all the features and functionality without going through development. In addition, it helps the testers to get an original feeling for using the application.",mobile
Mobile App Backend Development,"Usually, the users see the front end of an application. But, the server-side development is the back-end. Mainly, the back-end of a Mobile application is used to store, secure, and process data. To send information for processing on the server, you need back-end development. For example, user information processing like Signups, logins, messaging, storing data, and more essential tasks happened in the back-end of a mobile application. Some mobile software doesn’t need back-end development. That software can be a calculator, camera, notes, voice recorder, and so on. Because these apps can run on the mobile without any internet connection, and they don’t need to store or retrieve data from the server. But, Amazon, Netflix, or any internet-dependent application must need back-end development.",mobile
API- Application Programming Interface Development,"As I said before, many apps don’t need the support of the back-end. But the number of such applications is few. Most of the applications need connectivity, and they constantly communicate with servers. It means they use the back-end, web service, or APIs. Big companies like Amazon, Facebook, Google, or others provide these APIs. Many development teams can also develop API internally in the mobile app development stage. RestAPI is a standard and top-rated tool for building APIs. With it, anyone can interact and connect easily to a remote cloud data server.",mobile
Using Common Architecture,"If you are going to build your own API, then prefer the standard architecture. However, most of the developers use a usual architecture for a general baseline. Thus, you can speed up your mobile API development process. You may have heard about the four different types of common architecture. They are as follows: But, pragmatic REST is a top-rated and most popular for mobile app development.",mobile
Focusing on Security,"It is essential to focus mainly on security from the beginning to the end of the development. You can use readymade API or can build your own but must ensure security measures. Security is a crucial fact in mobile app development and a must-have component for developers. Before invoking a web-based API, developers need access control mechanisms, privacy control, and secret keys. Today, API standards like OAuth2, TLS, and Open ID are top-rated APIs that also make integration easier.",mobile
Quality Assurance,"Everyone wants to be sure whether a product is properly working or not. So, you must find out the problems of your product before your company releases it. In the quality assurance stage, ensure that the app is working well. See if the app is compatible with different size screens and a variety of platforms. Is it working well on each? You can also check the quality by providing beta testing. App’s Beta versions are only for selected customers who can test the app and give feedback. Protecting your client’s information is a must.

There’s no exact answer because every organization has its own unique needs, and naturally, investing in third party resources can seem like an uncertain investment. However, not all companies have the same resources as larger businesses, and when IT is essential to remain competitive, you can easily feel left behind. So, go over the following when considering third-party solutions: If any of these situations apply to your business, it’s probably time to seek IT services through a managed provider. Often, internal problems and instability lead to lost hours and ultimately hurt profit margins. Imagine, for instance, how a universal communication platform can help by centralizing how all staff communicates. Instead of Jerry from accounting missing an email because he was in a meeting, the software can indicate where he was and what he was doing at that time. The less time the staff spends running after each other in this scenario, the more time they can focus on their tasks. This is just one example among dozens which can offer resolutions to headache-inducing problems.",itservices
